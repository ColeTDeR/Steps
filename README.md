# Steps
I created this program to measure my daily exercise.

On any given day, as long as I'm not working all day, I have to get a certain amount of steps. On non-school days I have to get 8,000, and on school days I need 4,000. Another
option that I have is to ride my bike for an hour on non-school days or for half an hour on school days. The final option is to do a combination of those. For example, on a
weekend, I could ride my bike for half an hour and then get 4,000 steps.

The problem is, sometimes I want to figure out what the fastest thing to do is. That's where this program comes in. It automatically calculates about how long each thing will take
me based on how many steps I have, the total steps I need, and my walking and running speeds.
